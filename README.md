# Optimization Using Gradient Descent: Linear Regression

This project demonstrates linear regression to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. We explore three approaches:

Linear Regression using NumPy.
Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn.
Implementing Gradient Descent to optimize a cost function.
We also compare Linear Regression with at least one other algorithm to evaluate performance.
